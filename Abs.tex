\prefacesection{Abstract}

This project seeks to address the fact the 1\% per year of global electricity consumption is by data centres, which has increased in recent history \cite{KoomeyGrowthInDataCenterElectricityUse}. This increase in data centre energy consumption, if allowed to continue, is unsustainable [INCLUDE THE CITATION FOR THIS].
To address this concern, a model of a data centre is produced, taking the form of a simulation game requiring the user to outfit a data centre, requiring them to strike a balance between data storage and access capacity, economical viability and energy consumption. [The goal of producing this system is to provide a limited model usable to help illustrate concerns and possible procedures for reducing the energy consumption of data centres in their design and re-outfitting.]

\smallskip

This model is in three main components, the an [API] framework, which supports a database of components of data centres, such as server types, cooling systems as well as more abstract elements such as operation times and data-centre global locations. The [API] also supports a rule-set, which models the interaction of the data centre, such as different server types increasing the ambient temperature of the data centre by a set amount towards a maximum ambient temperature threshold, the exceeding of which would lead the player to loose the game. This simulation will ultimately include a GUI, allowing the game to be visualised as the outfitting of a [three-dimensional] data centre floor with these components.

[Third paragraph gives the results and conclusions.]
