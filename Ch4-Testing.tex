 \section{Integration of the application into the web-page for browser deployment\textcolor{red}{[FROM PRESENTATION SECTION 'Hosting']}}
 \label{sec:Methodology:TechnicalOverview:Hosting}
 The game will be hosted on a web server page to allow as many
 users as possible to access it.
 
 Furthermore, the game may later be developed into a mobile app by wrapping it using software such as PhoneGap \cite{PhoneGap}, allowing for the greatest possible cross-platform access to it.
